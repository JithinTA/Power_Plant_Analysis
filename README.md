POWER PLANT DATA ANALYSIS

The goal of this project was to conduct a complete data analysis project which includes data cleaning, data analysis and data visualisation. 

The project was done using SQL and Python (Libraries : - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and sql alchemy)

CITATION : The data was collected from World Resources Institute 2019 Global Power Plant Database through the githubs awesome datasets repository.

This is a vast dataset and a multitude of insights can be derived from this.

The questions that I was seeking an answer to were

1, What countries has the best power generation capacity
2, What countries generated the most energy from the year 2013 - 2017
3, What countries lead the world in wind energy production.
4, What countries lead the world in solar energy production
5, What are the top power plants in the world in terms of capacity.

PS : I worked with the estimated power generation data from the dataset. This entries are at the facility level only and not at the generation level.
